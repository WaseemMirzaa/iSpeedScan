# iSpeedScan

*A quick, privacy-first document scanner app for mobile devices.*

---

## Overview

iSpeedScan transforms your smartphone or tablet into a powerful, portable document scanner. With a few taps you can scan receipts, notes, business cards, contracts, or any paper documents — and save them as high-quality images (PNG) or PDFs. The app emphasizes speed, simplicity, and data privacy, making it an ideal tool for both personal and professional use.

## Features

### 📄 Versatile Scanning

* Automatically detect page edges and straighten documents. 
* Save scans as **PNG images** (ideal for receipts, business cards) or **multi-page PDFs** (perfect for contracts, reports, notes). 

### ✨ Smart Enhancement & Clean Output

* Auto-adjust lighting, brightness, and contrast to deliver clear, professional-looking scans — even from old, wrinkled, or poorly lit paper. 
* Real-time edge detection and cropping, so you don’t need to manually frame or adjust each scan. 

### 🔒 Privacy-First, Local Processing

* All scans and processing happen directly on your device — no cloud uploads or external servers. 
* No user account required, no data collected. 

### 🆓 Flexible Pricing: One-Time Payment

* Try all features free during a 1-week trial (including PDF mode). 
* After trial, basic scanning remains free forever, or unlock unlimited PDF scans and priority tools with a **one-time payment** (no subscriptions). 

### 📥 Broad Use Cases

* Scan receipts for expense tracking. 
* Digitize business cards, notes, letters, or signed contracts. 
* Archive documents: invoices, medical records, school notes, deliveries — everything you need in sharp, readable format.

## Platforms & Availability

* Available for **iOS (iPhone, iPad)**. 
* Also available for **Android** (via APK), supporting Android 5.0+ devices.

## Sample Workflow

1. Open iSpeedScan on your device.
2. Point the camera at the document you want to scan — edges and page detection will happen automatically.
3. The app crops and straightens the document, and applies auto-enhancement.
4. Choose to save as PNG or PDF (single or multi-page).
5. Save to your gallery or export/share via email, messaging, or any other sharing method supported by your device.

## Why iSpeedScan Stands Out

* It balances **simplicity and power** — ideal for users who want a quick scan without complex settings.
* Strong **privacy stance** — no cloud uploads, no accounts, no tracking.
* **Flexible, one-time payment model** — no recurring subscription fees.
* Great for a wide range of everyday needs: from receipts and invoices to school notes and formal documents.
